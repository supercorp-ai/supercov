# Supercov's stdlib-only Ruby runtime.
#
# Rust decides the denominator ahead of the run and ships it as a probe plan.
# This file, loaded through RUBYOPT before any application code, does three
# things and nothing else:
#
# 1. Starts Ruby's own Coverage module (lines, branches, methods) and turns
#    its per-phase deltas into first-sighting hits by matching the plan's keys.
# 2. Installs a RubyVM::InstructionSequence.load_iseq hook that splices the
#    plan's probe calls into application sources in memory as they load. The
#    files on disk are never touched; no insertion contains a newline.
# 3. Writes commit-framed evidence records that Rust joins into the run.
#
# It never computes a coverage verdict and never requires anything outside
# the standard library.

require "coverage"
# No `require "json"`: this file loads through RUBYOPT before Bundler sets up,
# and activating the json default gem here would clash with an application
# whose Gemfile pins another version. The plan is a Ruby literal and the
