//! Turning what a Supercov-owned runtime wrote into the model the report reads.
//!
//! Go, Java and Kotlin all write the same transport, because there is no
//! reason for them to differ and every reason not to: one format means one
//! reader, one set of edge cases, and no way for two languages to disagree
//! about what an evaluation was. Only the frontend declaration is per
//! language, because only that differs in substance.
//!
//! The transport itself is deliberately dumb — sparse pairs of probe ids and packed
//! vector words — because everything it could have computed instead is cheaper
//! to compute here, once, than in a process that is trying to run tests. The
//! mapping from probe id back to obligation lives in the manifest this module
//! is handed, so the runtime never carries a string.
