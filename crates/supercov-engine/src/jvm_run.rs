//! Public, isolated JVM coverage run lifecycle, for Java and Kotlin.
//!
//! Supercov owns the probes, so measuring a project means rewriting its
//! sources. That happens on a copy in an isolated workspace; the tree the
//! author edits is never touched.
//!
//! The build system runs the tests, and Supercov puts three things where that
//! build will find them without being reconfigured:
//!
//! - `Supercov` in the main source set, because instrumented product code
//!   stores into its probe array;
//! - `SupercovListener` and a generated `SupercovConfig` in the test source
//!   set, because attribution comes from the JUnit Platform and only the test
//!   classpath has it;
//! - a services file registering the listener, and a
//!   `junit-platform.properties` that turns parallel execution off.
//!
//! That last one is prevention rather than detection. Two tests running at
//! once share one probe array, so the runtime cannot attribute either, and it
//! notices and says so — but the better outcome is that it never happens, and
//! Supercov owns the workspace, so it can simply make sure of it.
