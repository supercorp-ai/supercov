//! Changed-line coverage: are the lines this change touches tested?
//!
//! The denominator is the part that has to be right. It is the intersection of
//! two facts already established elsewhere: the lines a patch added or
//! modified, and the lines the run's language adapter decided were executable.
//! Taking the intersection means comments, blank lines and declarations are
//! excluded because the adapter already excluded them, not because this module
//! guessed at syntax it does not parse.
//!
//! Git invocation lives at the edge, in the CLI. Everything here is a pure
//! function of a diff and a run view, so the cases that matter -- renames,
//! deletions, comment-only changes, files absent from the recording -- are
//! testable without a repository.
