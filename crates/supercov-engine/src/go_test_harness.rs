//! Binding Go's test functions to the evidence they produce.
//!
//! Attribution needs two things the source does not have: every test function
//! announcing itself, and somewhere to write the evidence once the package has
//! finished. Go gives exactly one after-all hook, `TestMain`, so this augments
//! the package's own when it has one and synthesises it when it does not.
//!
//! The wrapping is deliberate rather than a deferred call. The idiomatic
//! `TestMain` ends in `os.Exit(m.Run())`, and `os.Exit` runs no deferred
//! function, so a `defer` there would silently produce no evidence for exactly
//! the projects that wrote the most careful harness.
