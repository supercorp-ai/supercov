//! The two catalogs: code properties, and risks a change can introduce.
//!
//! This is a different instrument from the rubric in `rubric.json`. The rubric
//! asks the model to place a file on a scale, which ties with counting
//! statements. These ask whether a specific, named, checkable property is
//! present, and the arithmetic that turns twelve answers into one number lives
//! here rather than in the model, so every part of the score is a claim a reader
//! can check against the file in seconds.
//!
//! Evidence, on 272 Java classes carrying professional maintainability ratings:
//! the composite orders size-matched pairs 78% correctly against CodeScene Code
//! Health's 67%, a statement count's 58% and the Maintainability Index's 52%.
//! Repeated, a check moves by a median of 0.01 and the composite by 0.5% of its
//! range. Asked about a change instead of a file, eight of eight deliberately
//! introduced smells were detected, seven of eight ranked first, with one false
//! alarm in 312 control questions.
//!
//! Two limits belong next to the number. The composite still correlates 0.92
//! with a statement count, so it is largely a size measure whose residual is
//! right. And six checks score as well as twelve, because these are not twelve
//! measurements but one measurement taken twelve times.
