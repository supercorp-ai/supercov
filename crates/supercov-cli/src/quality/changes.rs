//! Which change to review, and the two versions of every file in it.
//!
//! Three ranges cover the three moments a review is wanted: before a commit,
//! before a push, and on a pull request. They differ only in where `before` and
//! `after` are read from, so one selector serves all three and any later command
//! that works on a change can take the same flags.
//!
//! Whole files are read, never hunks. A hunk cannot answer whether a change
//! introduced a property or whether the file already had it, which is the whole
//! question, so the extra tokens are the point rather than an oversight.
