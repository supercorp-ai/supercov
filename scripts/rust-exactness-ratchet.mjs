// Exactness ratchet: measure the exact fraction per crate and refuse a
// regression.
//
// The north star's measure of success for HONEST is that the exact fraction
// ratchets toward 100% and no release ever regresses it. Tonight that promise
// depended on remembering to measure widely, and it failed: a change measured
// on six crates showed two gains and no regressions, while serde_json had
// dropped 91.98% -> 66.22% and serde_core 95.03% -> 80.76%. The crates that
// moved were exactly the ones not sampled, which is the normal case — a binder
// change moves failures between stages, so the crates leaning on the changed
// stage are the ones that move.
//
//   node scripts/rust-exactness-ratchet.mjs measure   # build the crate set, print fractions
//   node scripts/rust-exactness-ratchet.mjs baseline  # measure and store as the baseline
//   node scripts/rust-exactness-ratchet.mjs check     # measure and fail on any regression
