// Nothing here bumps by substring. A dependency pin can share the release's
// prefix -- `ra_ap_syntax` is pinned at 0.0.349, which starts with 0.0.34 -- and
// a substring bump rewrites it to a version that does not exist. That fails
// nowhere locally and everywhere on the release runners, after the tag is
// already pushed.
//
// Nor does it bump by quoted occurrence any more. That worked while Supercov's
// version was one no dependency shared, and stopped at 1.0.0: the lockfile
// carries 31 third-party ranges like "^1.0.0" and two crates sit at 1.0.0
// exactly, so a quoted replacement across those files would rewrite other
// people's versions. Each file is edited where Supercov's version actually
// lives -- our own manifests wholesale, the two lockfiles only inside the
// entries we own -- and every file has a known number of references. Any other
// count means the world changed and the bump stops rather than guessing.
