# Evidence archive contract v1

The immutable published evidence artifact is `evidence.raw.gz`. Its evidence
schema version is `2`; this is independent of the encompassing contract
version.

After gzip decompression the byte stream is:

1. ASCII magic `SUPERCOV-EVIDENCE-2\n`.
2. Zero or more entries sorted by archive path using Unicode code-point order.
3. For each entry:
   - a four-byte unsigned big-endian header length;
   - a UTF-8 JSON header followed by `\n`, exactly
     `{"path":<string>,"bytes":<non-negative integer>}\n`;
   - exactly `bytes` uninterpreted payload bytes.

Archive paths use `/`, are unique, non-empty, relative, and sorted by Unicode
code-point order. Empty, `.`, and `..` segments, trailing separators,
backslashes, NULs, absolute paths, duplicate paths, and unsorted paths are
invalid. Headers must have the exact key order and compact JSON encoding shown
above, with no unknown keys or whitespace variation. Truncated
headers/payloads, invalid byte lengths, invalid UTF-8 header data, invalid
magic, another gzip member, trailing compressed bytes, and trailing non-entry
data are fatal corruption. Readers must reject the whole archive rather than
partially trust it or call its measurement complete. Payloads remain arbitrary
bytes; only individual evidence namespaces may impose UTF-8/JSON requirements.

Required namespaces:

- exactly one `manifest.json`: the complete structural denominator.
- runner evidence at its transport-relative paths.
- `server/attempts/*.jsonl`: attributed server evidence.
- `server/background/*.jsonl`: aggregate/unattributed evidence.

JSONL preserves one JSON object per line and a final newline. File names are
transport only and do not establish attribution; record scope does. Evidence
may be batched and deduplicated only when doing so cannot remove a distinct
coverage vector, phase, attempt, outcome, or confidence observation.

Writers publish the gzip file atomically. Ordering and gzip output must be
deterministic for identical logical inputs. Publication metadata records file
count, uncompressed bytes, compressed bytes, format, and evidence schema.
