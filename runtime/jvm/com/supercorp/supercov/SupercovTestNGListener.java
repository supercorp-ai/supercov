 * its own. The mechanism is the same in spirit — the framework announces each
 * test and Supercov records against it — and so the test sources stay
 * untouched here too.
 *
 * <p>Registered by putting its name in
 * {@code META-INF/services/org.testng.ITestNGListener}. Supercov writes that
 * file into the instrumented workspace, and writes this class there only when
 * the project actually depends on TestNG: compiling it anywhere else would
 * fail on imports the project never asked for.
