# Engine plan — research findings and open spikes (2026-08-24)

Companion to `engine-master-plan-2026-08-24.md`. What comparable projects do,
what that changes in our plan, and the spikes that must close before each
phase starts.

## Findings from other projects

### 1. TypeScript's Go port (tsgo): port structurally, never redesign mid-port
Microsoft ported tsc file-by-file, keeping the code *structurally identical*
to the TS implementation, then validated against ~20,000 existing compiler
test cases and multi-million-LOC real codebases. They did not "improve" logic
during the port. **Implication:** our Rust port mirrors the TS modules
one-to-one (same decision order, same naming, same edge-case handling), and
all redesigns (probe v2, bitset MC/DC pair search) land on the TS engine
*before* the port so Rust targets frozen semantics. This confirms and
hardens our phase ordering.

### 2. Ruff's "ecosystem check": the differential harness should be permanent
Ruff runs every PR against a pinned corpus of real-world repositories and
comments the behavioral diff. Biome published a Prettier-compatibility score
computed from Prettier's own test suite. **Implication:** the Tier-1
compatibility sweep corpus (pinned SHAs) graduates into a standing
"ecosystem check": a scheduled CI job that runs the engine against the corpus
and diffs evidence/reports against the previous engine build. During the
port, parity is publishable as a number ("N/M corpus runs byte-identical").
Budget note: run nightly/on-demand, not per-PR — Actions minutes are a
constraint the user has set.

### 3. LLVM MC/DC: per-decision bitmaps are the probe-v2 design
Clang's `-fcoverage-mcdc` allocates one 2^n-bit bitmap per decision (n =
conditions); each condition probe is a single bitwise-OR; the executed test
vector sets one bit; llvm-cov reconstructs vectors offline. **Implication:**
probe v2's JS analog is a per-decision typed-array bitmap with integer
condition indices (`frame |= 1 << i`, then
`bitmap[v >> 3] |= 1 << (v & 7)`), replacing string-keyed function calls on
the hot path. Per-test attribution — which LLVM does not do — comes from
swapping bitmap buffers per attempt epoch, keeping our concurrent-runner
attribution. Sizing: our largest observed decision has 10 conditions
(128-byte bitmap); enforce a cap with explicit degradation like LLVM does.
Offline reconstruction moves the vector→independence-pair work fully into
analysis, off the user's runtime.

### 4. oxc: production-ready parser, custom transforms are the open question
The oxc parser is production infrastructure (Rolldown, Vite's plugin-react
React-refresh transform, Nuxt; oxlint at Shopify/ByteDance/Preact). Custom
AST rewriting uses `oxc_traverse`/transformer plugins. Risks: crate APIs
still move fast (pin + vendor), and our instrumenter needs exact evaluation-
order-preserving rewrites, not off-the-shelf transforms. **Implication:**
Phase 3 starts with a spike (S1) porting the three hairiest instrumenter
features before committing.

### 5. napi-rs v3: platform packages + WASI fallback is a solved pattern
Per-target binaries as scoped `optionalDependencies` with an automatic
`wasm32-wasip1-threads` fallback for platforms without prebuilds, plus
version-mismatch guards in the loader. Known footgun: a `wasm-runtime`
release once broke `npm ci` — pin the fallback chain exactly.
**Implication:** npm distribution for the Phase-3 instrumenter addon and the
Phase-4/5 engine binary is copy-paste engineering, including exotic-platform
coverage via WASI.

### 6. cargo-dist: alive, but decide with an ADR
Actively maintained (0.32.0, May 2026); Astral forked it for uv and their
fixes merged back upstream. But some projects (e.g. googleworkspace/cli)
left it for hand-written pipelines with npm sub-packages, and it has no PyPI
target — maturin `bindings = "bin"` wheels remain the PyPI path regardless.
**Implication:** Phase 5 opens with an ADR: cargo-dist for
Releases/brew/curl/msi + separate maturin and napi jobs, versus one
hand-rolled matrix. Either way PyPI and npm are custom steps.

### 7. reflink-copy: workspace isolation parity in Rust is done
The `reflink-copy` crate (used by uv, maturin, and pnpm's NAPI cloning
package) wraps macOS `clonefile` and Linux `FICLONE` with copy fallback —
exactly our workspace semantics. Windows: CoW only on ReFS/Dev Drive;
regular NTFS falls back to real copies, so the Windows workspace-prep gate
needs its own budget number rather than inheriting the mac one.

### 8. rkyv: zero-copy mmap index is real; format needs an ADR
rkyv gives true zero-copy access from an mmapped file including a paged B+
tree for bulk data; the community caveat is that it is a heavy dependency
that couples schema versioning to the crate. One property simplifies our
choice a lot: **the query index is immutable per run** (write-once, integrity
-checked), so we need no update concurrency — plain fixed-layout sections or
rkyv both work; SQLite is likely overkill. Settle by benchmark spike (S2).

## Plan amendments from these findings

- Parity gate wording clarified: **byte-identical manifests and evidence,
  behaviorally equivalent generated code.** Babel and oxc will never emit
  identical JS text; Test262 equivalence + identical manifests/evidence is
  the correct gate.
- The Tier-1 sweep corpus is a launch asset *and* the permanent ecosystem-
  check input; build it with pinned SHAs and cached clones from day one.
- Probe v2 adopts the LLVM bitmap model with epoch-swapped buffers for
  attribution; vector reconstruction moves offline into analysis.
- Distribution: napi platform-package pattern (with WASI fallback) for npm;
  maturin bin wheels for PyPI; cargo-dist vs hand-rolled decided by ADR in
  Phase 5.

## Open spikes (each blocks the phase it feeds)

- **S1 (→ Phase 3): oxc port spike.** Port optional-call completeness,
  source-sensitive function detection, and MC/DC condition wrapping to
  oxc_traverse; run the pinned Test262 shard subset. Exit: zero semantic
  failures, manifest byte-parity on fixtures, measured transform throughput.
- **S2 (→ Phase 4): index format ADR.** Benchmark rkyv vs flatbuffers vs
  fixed-layout custom vs status-quo gzipped JSON on a synthetic 100k-line
  run. Exit: open+first-query ≤15 ms at p95 on the large index, versioning
  and integrity story written down.
- **S3 (→ any binary GA): Windows strategy.** Job objects for process-group
  termination (command-group/nix equivalents), junction vs symlink for
  workspace node_modules, NTFS copy fallback budget, Dev Drive reflink
  detection. Exit: full test suite green on Windows CI, workspace-prep gate
  number set.
- **S4 (→ Phase 4): process-supervision spec.** Enumerate current cli.ts
  child-process behaviors (detached groups, signal escalation timeline,
  stdio inheritance, exit-code mapping) as a contract test both engines run.
- **S5 (→ Phase 2): carrier overhead measurement.** AsyncLocalStorage cost
  dominates probe attribution; Node 24+ enables AsyncContextFrame which
  changes the numbers. Exit: measured overhead budget per Node version,
  informing how aggressively probes can consult the carrier.
- **S6 (→ Phase 5): registry groundwork.** PyPI/npm name availability and
  scope naming for platform sub-packages, wheel platform tags
  (manylinux/musllinux/universal2/win), sdist policy, brew tap vs core.
- **S7 (→ Phase 1): perf CI.** Criterion/hyperfine harness wired to the
  acceptance-gate table so gates are enforced by CI, not by memory; corpus
  ecosystem-check scheduled nightly with cached clones.
- **S8 (→ Phase 6, Rust): insertion-point ADR.** rustc MC/DC status and
  stability, then MIR pass vs out-of-tree LLVM plugin vs source transform,
  including the ongoing cost of tracking LLVM/rustc release cadence. Exit:
  ADR with a maintenance-burden estimate per option.
- **S9 (→ Phase 6, C/C++): Tier A sufficiency.** clang's per-decision
  condition cap and its configurability; we already observe 10-condition
  decisions in JS, so Tier A must degrade explicitly rather than silently
  merge. Exit: cap documented, degradation specified.
- **S10 (→ Phase 6): attribution-ladder validation.** Per-test evidence from
  a real Rust crate under `cargo nextest` (process-per-test = exact
  attribution), MC/DC verdicts matching `llvm-cov` on the same run. Exit: a
  golden-corpus fixture shaped like today's JS fixtures.

Detail for S8–S10, the two-tier model and the per-language matrix live in
`multi-language-architecture-2026-08-24.md`.

## Risk register (new since master plan)

- oxc API churn → pin exact crate versions, vendor if needed; revisit each
  phase boundary.
- WASI fallback chain can break installs → exact pins + install-matrix CI.
- Windows CoW absence changes workspace performance class → own gate (S3).
- AsyncLocalStorage overhead varies by Node version → measure, don't assume
  (S5).
- cargo-dist single-vendor risk → ADR keeps hand-rolled exit path (S6/Phase 5).
- Owning compiled-language instrumentation means tracking LLVM/rustc release
  cadence indefinitely; this is the dominant long-term cost of Phase 6 Tier B
  and must be priced before committing to a plugin (S8).
- Per-language equivalence corpora, not instrumenters, are the real cost
  driver for new languages. Treat a missing corpus as a hard ship blocker,
  not a documentation gap.
